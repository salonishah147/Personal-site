Over the years, marketers have faced various challenges trying to build creative and effective marketing campaigns. Budget cuts, frequent social media algorithm changes, and finding the most efficient tools and technology. 

But a pandemic with 3+ billion people living in lockdown? No one in their wildest dreams could have ever imagined being faced with this. But nonetheless, creativity was still thriving. Brands and agencies emerged with some of their best campaigns to date (in my opinion). 

### 1. Spotify- Listening Together

In a time when we are forced to stay apart, being connected with people feels like a luxury. For a lot of us, music has always been a bridge that brings us closer to one another. To celebrate the power of unity through music, Spotify launched a global campaign- “Listening Together.”

They created a real-time microsite wherein you can see what track people are listening to at the same time as well as the country/ city where the connection is happening through a virtual, rotating 3D map of Earth.

### 2. Jupiler- Postpone Your Birthday

Are zoom birthday parties going to become the new norm? I hope not. Birthday blues were a real thing during this lockdown. No friends. No parties. Just you and the cake that you baked for yourself (honestly, kudos to you!)

To make up for all of the lost birthday cheers, Jupiler, a Belgian beer brand asked people to postpone their birthdays by selecting a new date after the lockdown and offered them 10 free pints of beer to celebrate with friends at their favorite bar.


### 3. Orange- #OnResteEnsemble

Being just a single click away from our friends and family has made this isolation period a little less lonely. But for many, this is not easy, particularly for seniors due to lack of digital literacy. That’s why Orange, a telephone operator in France, offered ad space on television to French people so they can share videos with their elders directly on TV. 

### 4. Ikea- Build Your Own Fort

Being stuck at home and having to keep children entertained every minute can be draining. The urge to simply hand them a smartphone must be at an all-time high. To solve this problem for parents, Ikea Russia designed six easy-to-build kids’ forts using Ikea furniture. These structures include the Fortress, Wigwam, Castle, Cave, Campingtent, and House.


### 5. Studio Ghibli- Live The Anime Life!

It was the perfect opportunity for anime lovers to experience living in an anime world. Since a lot of people started working from home, Studio Ghibli, a Japanese animation studio, released eight background wallpapers of its classical anime films- Spirited Away, Castle In The Sky, and Howl’s Moving Castle to use during video conferences.
