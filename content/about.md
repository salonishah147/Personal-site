# About Me

I am a Mass Media student currently pursuing my MSc in Strategic Marketing at Imperial College Business School, London. I have experience managing teams and campaigns which comes to light through my contribution in college fests and internships. My background is in brand strategy, mass media, and marketing. I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of advertising and community development. I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in media relations and stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.

My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has made me try out a lot of things from volunteering to programming! I believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet I live out through my interests in yoga, art, etc.
